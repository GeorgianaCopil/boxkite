## Where did the name "boxkite" come from?

The [Bristol Boxkite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Boxkite) is an early biplane, it was the first plane to take off in Singapore.

This celebrates the Bristol/Singapore connection between the founders of this project: [Luke Marsden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-marsden-71b3789/) in Bristol, England and the [Basis-AI](https://basis-ai.com/about) team in Singapore.

The logo is based on the concept of a camera, for monitoring, plus the Boxkite plane.
